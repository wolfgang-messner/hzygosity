Cultural heterozygosity: Towards a new measure of within-country cultural diversity

This software provides an implementation of the cultural heterozygosity index described in the following research article:

Messner, W. (2022) Cultural Heterozygosity: Towards a New Measure of Within-Country Cultural Diversity. Journal of World Business, Volume 57, Issue 4, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jwb.2022.101346


Following an analogy from evolutionary biology, the software computes a novel index of heterozygosity, which compares all instances in a data set with each other. In contrast to the standard deviation measure, heterozygosity does not require the data to follow any kind of distribution.
